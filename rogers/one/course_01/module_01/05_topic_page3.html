        <h1>What’s Geography?</h1>
        <p>Geography is one of the oldest subjects in the world and, as you’ll see through the course, is fundamental in many aspects of our everyday lives. Geography is about the study of the Earth. In particular, it is the process of both describing and analyzing human and physical phenomena over the Earth’s surface and the interrelationships among those various actions.</p>

            <p class="lead">“As a young man, my fondest dream was to become a geographer. However, while working in the customs office I thought deeply about the matter and concluded that it was far too difficult a subject. With some reluctance, I then turned to physics as a substitute.” </p>
