      <h2>Humber College</h2>
      <h3>Graphic Design &#8226; Social &#8226; UX</h3>
      <p>While I was working at Humber College, Humber's leadership wanted to make an effort to get students that received early offers of admission to accept their offers sooner.</p>
      <p>To contribute to this endeavour, I used social media to engage with these students and get them excited about attending Humber. With the help of the Student Recruitment department I created a short video encouraging potential students to show how excited they were about receiving their acceptance letters.</p>
